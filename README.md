**Project Name - Netflix Content Analysis and Clustering**

**Project Summary -**
**Objective**

The primary goal is to explore the evolution of Netflix's content catalog and develop a model to cluster similar content. This is motivated by a 2018 Flixable report indicating a significant strategic shift where the number of TV shows nearly tripled since 2010, while the number of movies decreased by over 2,000 titles.

**Key Deliverables**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

A thorough examination of the dataset to understand content distribution by type (Movie/TV Show), release year, rating, and duration, and to handle missing or inconsistent data.

Geographic Content Analysis:

An investigation into the geographic distribution of content to understand what type of content is available in different countries.

Content Strategy Trend Analysis:

Verification of the reported trend by quantifying if Netflix has been increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years, using the content's date added or release year.

Content Clustering:

Applying text-based feature matching (e.g., using titles, descriptions, cast, and genres) to cluster similar TV shows and movies together.

Potential for Expansion

The project also identifies the potential for integrating external datasets (such as IMDB ratings or Rotten Tomatoes scores) in the future to yield deeper insights into content popularity and critical reception.

**Problem Statement**
Netflix, a dominant global streaming platform, is undergoing a significant strategic transformation in its content library. A report from 2018 indicated that since 2010, the platform's focus has dramatically shifted, resulting in a near-tripling of TV show titles and a reduction of over 2,000 movie titles.

This project seeks to address the following questions using the Netflix dataset:

Content Strategy Validation: Can the provided dataset validate and quantify the extent to which Netflix is prioritizing the addition of TV shows over movies in recent years?

Global Content Footprint: What is the diversity and distribution of content types (Movies vs. TV Shows) across different countries, and what are the characteristics of the content originating from key geographic regions?

Content Discoverability: Can an unsupervised learning model (clustering) be built using text-based features (like title, description, cast, and genres) to group similar content, thereby creating a system that could potentially enhance content recommendation and discoverability for users?

The successful completion of this project will provide data-driven insights into Netflix's evolving content strategy and establish a foundational clustering model for its diverse catalog.


**Business Objesctive**
The project tasks directly align with several key business goals for a streaming platform like Netflix:

1.Strategic Content Investment Objective: To validate and understand the content strategy shift.

Relates to Task: "If Netflix has been increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years."

Business Value: Provides data to justify future investment decisions. If TV shows drive subscriber engagement and retention, the analysis confirms this focus. It helps Content Acquisition teams allocate their budget more effectively between producing/licensing Movies versus TV Shows.

2.Global Market Penetration Objective: To optimize content offerings for specific geographic markets.

Relates to Task: "Understanding what type content is available in different countries."

Business Value: Helps Regional Content Managers understand the dominant content type or genre in a specific country (e.g., is India's library heavily skewed toward International Movies?) and identify gaps where local content creation or licensing could increase subscriber numbers in that region.

3.Improving User Experience and Retention Objective: To enhance the content recommendation engine.

Relates to Task: "Clustering similar content by matching text-based features."

Business Value: The content clusters can be used to improve the accuracy and relevance of personalized recommendations. If the system can accurately group content by theme, cast, and director, it provides better "If you liked this, you'll love that" suggestions, which is crucial for increasing user engagement and reducing churn (cancellation).

In summary, the project serves as a data-driven decision support system for Netflix, translating raw catalog data into actionable insights for investment, global expansion, and user retention
